<h1>Hourly Reminders</h1>

<p>Sometimes there is a particular task you wish to do or be reminded about every hour or so, such as getting up and walking around to stretch our your legs. TimeBuddy has a feature that gives you a custom message once per hour. The "hour" starts as soon as TimeBuddy is started.</p>

<p>To specify an hourly reminder:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the <em>Settings</em> window the same as when creating a task</li>
  <li>Select the <em>Options</em> tab</li>
  <li>Type in the message you wish to receive next to the <em>Hourly Reminder</em> check box</li>
  <li>Check the box to enable the reminder (or uncheck to disable)</li>
</ol>
