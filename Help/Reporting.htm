<h1>Reporting</h1>

<p>To generate a report, click the TimeBuddy icon <img src="Systray Icon.gif"> in the system tray (near the clock in the task bar) and select the <em>Report...</em> item.</p>

<p>In this example report, we see a number of tasks with time tracked against them. Any task that does not have time tracked against it will not be visible in this list. Note how the tasks prefixed with a number are summarized at the end of the report with the "100" series tasks combined.</p>

<p>Two additional summaries are provided: <em>Total</em>, which represents the total number of real time tracked, and <em>Lost</em>, which represents the time lost due to rounding summaries. The <em>List</em> figure is only available when <em>Rounding Summaries</em> is enabled in the <em>Options</em> window.

<p>The <em>HH:MM</em> column denotes the number of hours and minutes tracked against each task, while the <em>Hours</em> column is a fractional hours value. For example, for <em>100 Task A</em> which has 30 minutes tracked against it is represented as 0.5 hours. This is useful for data entry into other reporting system which only accept hourly values.</p>

<p>Tasks must have at least 5 minutes tracked against them in order for them to be displayed on this report. Tasks with less than 5 minutes tracked against them are ignored and are not displayed or otherwise considered.</p>

<p>After transferring your hours into your management system, you may clear all counters at once via the <em>Clear Counters</em> button in the <em>Settings</em> window.</p>
